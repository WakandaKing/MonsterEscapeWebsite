	<li>Game Concept</li>
	<p> Monster Escape is an RPG Adventure platform game where you play as Jace Gilbret on quest for the 	treasure thats guard by the Monstrous Gorzoth. Use leap over, dodge, avoid and watch out for the various 	enemies and traps especially who has an instant fatal touch.</p>
	<li>Target Audience</li>
	<p> Monster Escape is a platform game that's playable for all ages.</p>
	<li>Monetization Strategy</li>
	<p> Monster Escape is a free to play game with hopes for seasonal level aka Halloween and boss levels 	aimed to dive deeper into the lore that are obtained by purchasing a bonus pass.</p>
	<li>Development Timeline</li>
	<p> Monster Escape is a game that I will develop monthly with the challenges of creating and desiging new 	enemies and traps. Pushing for more mechanices that will allow the enemies to move at faster pace and make 	them deadlier with the purpose of challenging the fanbase.</p>
	<li>Marketing Strategy</li>
	<p> Monster Escape is a game I will promoted via several social media outlets. First off will be on my on 	Twitch and Youtube channels. I will create shorts featuring gameplay and new promo videos for TikTok, 	YouTube Shorts and Instagram story to help gain new players.</p>
	<li>Marketing Strategy</li>
	<p>If we future collaboration is continued Caleb Le will work development and design of level layout, 	Nathan Vu will work new player elements, and I will work designing and animating new enemies and 	bosses. If there is no future collaboration then I will develop it all myself </p>
