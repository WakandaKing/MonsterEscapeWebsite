        <p>Gorzoth is a dangerous, fowl, vicious and rentless creature bent on taking the life of anynoe who tries 	to take his treasure. Born out of the realm of Cthulhu it is said that he was born from one of Cthulhu 	tentacles. Eventhough he has one eye he sees all and if he catches you, he will let out a eerie scream and 	that will be the sound of your doom.   </p>
